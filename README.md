# Login Sample App

Login is a sample app that shows how to insert a login view in to `UINavigationController` backed application. The sample shows how to provide a `LogOut` exit action, to be used from other views and how to handle a successful login.

The app is based on the Master/Detail template project with all the code isolated to a single `LoginController`, plus minor Storyboard configuration.

I didn't think this was complex enough a problem to require a blog post, but if anyone disagrees, [let me know](http://twitter.com/pj_) and I'll write one up on [my blog](http://blog.paulj.me).
